Gemini-Historical-Artifact-Description

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
The project is based on the concept of Generative AI. The website allows the user to input an image of an artifact along with a user prompt and the model in return generates the description of the artifact including information about the origin, cultural significance, and historical significance of the artifact. The Gemini model used here is the Gemini 1.5 Flash model to achieve the aim of the project. The Gemini 1.5 Flash model is a multimodal AI, capable of processing both images and text.


LIBRARIES USED:
Streamlit: Used for building the web application interface.
Pillow: Utilized for image processing and handling.
google-generativeai: Used to interact with the Gemini 1.5 Flash API.
python-dotenv: Employed for managing environment variables and API keys.


FEATURES:
Image Upload: Allows the user to input an image of an artifact in .jpg, .jpeg, or .png formats.
Custom Prompts: Allows the user to give specific prompts or context to guide the description.
Data Export: Once the description is generated, it allows the user to download the description as a text file.
